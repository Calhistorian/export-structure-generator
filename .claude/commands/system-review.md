# Review System Overview

Before proceeding with any implementation, debugging, or architectural work, you must:

1. **Read the Complete System Overview**: Review @docs/comprehensive-system-overview.md to understand the full system architecture, component relationships, data flow patterns, and
integration points.

2. **Wait for Further Instructions**: After reading the system overview, STOP and wait for additional instructions. Do not proceed with any implementation work until you have:
    - Demonstrated understanding of the system architecture
    - Confirmed the scope and approach for your task
    - Received explicit approval to proceed

**Key Rule**: No work should begin without first establishing a complete understanding of the system context through the comprehensive overview document. This ensures all subsequent work
aligns with the established architecture and avoids conflicts with existing patterns.

Please read the system overview now and then wait for further instructions.
